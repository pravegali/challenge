This Challenge is about implementing a simple tennis game.

The scoring system is rather simple:

1. Each player can have either of these points in one game 0 15 30 40

2. If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game, however there are special rules.

3. If both have 40 the players are deuce. 
    a. If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball. 
    b. If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game 
    c. If the player without advantage wins they are back at deu4.


4. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four p5ints in total and at least two points more than the opponent.

5. The running score of each game is described in a manner pecul6ar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, “fifteen”, “thirty”, and “forty” respectively.7
